# Testing Notifications for Belang App

## What I've implemented:

âœ… **Local Notifications**: Added flutter_local_notifications package
âœ… **Permission Handling**: Added permission_handler package  
âœ… **Notification Service**: Created a centralized NotificationService class
âœ… **Real-time Message Notifications**: Notifications trigger when receiving messages
âœ… **Test Button**: Added a "Test Notifications" button in the Profile screen
âœ… **Android Configuration**: Updated build.gradle.kts with core library desugaring

## How to test:

1. **Test Basic Notifications**:
   - Open the app
   - Go to Profile screen
   - Tap "Test Notifications" button
   - You should see a notification in your notification panel

2. **Test Message Notifications**:
   - Have two devices/users logged in
   - Send a message from one user to another
   - The receiving user should get a notification

## Key Features:

- **Real-time**: Uses Appwrite realtime subscriptions to detect new messages
- **User-specific**: Only shows notifications for messages where you are the receiver
- **Customizable**: Different notification channels for messages vs general notifications
- **Permission-aware**: Requests notification permissions on first run

## Files Modified:

- `pubspec.yaml` - Added notification dependencies
- `lib/services/notification_service.dart` - New centralized notification service
- `lib/main.dart` - Initialize notification service on app start
- `lib/features/profile/screens/profile-screen.dart` - Added test button
- `lib/core/themes/app_colors.dart` - Added primary color
- `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` - Added notification permissions
- `android/app/build.gradle.kts` - Added core library desugaring

## Next Steps:

1. Test on a physical Android device for best results
2. Customize notification sounds and icons as needed
3. Add notification tap actions to navigate to specific chats
4. Consider adding notification settings/preferences

The notification system is now fully integrated and ready to use! ðŸŽ‰
